## 3.1.1 Requirements Engineering in the Age of AI-Assisted Development

Requirements engineering has evolved significantly with the advent of AI-assisted development tools. Traditional approaches focused on lengthy documentation and formal specification methods. Vibe coding introduces new paradigms where requirements can be expressed more naturally and validated more rapidly.

### The Cost of Poor Requirements

Research consistently shows that requirements-related issues are the leading cause of software project failures:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Software Project Failure Causes"
        A["Incomplete Requirements<br/>13.1%"] --> F["Total Requirements Issues<br/>~40% of failures"]
        B["Changing Requirements<br/>8.7%"] --> F
        C["Unrealistic Expectations<br/>9.9%"] --> F
        D["Lack of User Involvement<br/>12.4%"] --> F
        E["Other Issues<br/>56%"]
    end
    
    subgraph "Cost Impact Over Time"
        G["Requirements Phase<br/>Cost: 1x"] --> H["Design Phase<br/>Cost: 1.3x"]
        H --> I["Coding Phase<br/>Cost: 2x"]
        I --> J["Testing Phase<br/>Cost: 4x"]
        J --> K["System Test<br/>Cost: 13x"]
        K --> L["Field Use<br/>Cost: 80-130x"]
    end

    style B fill:#ffcdd2
    style C fill:#ffcdd2
    style D fill:#ffcdd2
    style F fill:#ff5722,color:#fff
```

**Key Insight**: Fixing a requirements defect in production costs 80-130 times more than fixing it during requirements gathering.

## 3.1.2 Types of Requirements in Modern Software Development

### Functional Requirements

**Definition**: Statements of services the system should provide, how it should react to particular inputs, and how it should behave in particular situations.

#### **Examples in Vibe Coding Context**:

```
User Story: "As a project manager, I want to view a dashboard showing team productivity metrics so that I can make informed decisions about resource allocation."

Vibe Coding Prompt:
"Create a project management dashboard that displays:
- Team member activity levels (commits, PRs, issues closed)
- Sprint progress with burn-down charts
- Resource allocation visualization
- Predictive analytics for project completion dates

Use React for the frontend, integrate with GitHub API for data, and include responsive design for mobile access."
```

#### **Characteristics of Good Functional Requirements**:
- **Specific**: Clear, unambiguous statements
- **Measurable**: Can be verified through testing
- **Achievable**: Technically feasible with available resources
- **Relevant**: Aligned with business objectives
- **Time-bound**: Have clear delivery expectations

### Non-Functional Requirements

**Definition**: Constraints on the services or functions offered by the system, often applying to the system as a whole.

#### **Categories of Non-Functional Requirements**:

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Non-Functional Requirements"
        A["Product Requirements"] --> A1["Performance<br/>Usability<br/>Reliability"]
        B["Organizational Requirements"] --> B1["Standards<br/>Implementation<br/>Operational"]
        C["External Requirements"] --> C1["Regulatory<br/>Legal<br/>Ethical"]
    end
    
    subgraph "Vibe Coding Enhancements"
        D["AI-Generated<br/>Quality Metrics"] --> A1
        E["Automated<br/>Compliance Checks"] --> B1
        F["Ethics-Aware<br/>Code Generation"] --> C1
    end
    
    style A fill:#e3f2fd
    style B fill:#f3e5f5
    style C fill:#e8f5e8
```

#### **Performance Requirements Example**:
```
Traditional: "The system shall process 10,000 transactions per minute with 99.9% uptime."

Vibe Coding Enhanced: "Build a high-performance transaction processing system that:
- Handles 10,000 TPS with sub-100ms response times
- Includes automatic scaling based on load patterns
- Implements circuit breakers for fault tolerance

describe('User Authentication Requirements Verification', () => {
  test('REQ-AUTH-001: Email registration with verification', async () => {
    // Test email registration flow
    const result = await registerUser('test@example.com', 'password123');
    expect(result.success).toBe(true);
    expect(result.emailVerificationSent).toBe(true);
  });
  
  test('REQ-AUTH-002: Social login integration', async () => {
    // Test Google OAuth flow
    const result = await authenticateWithGoogle(mockGoogleToken);
    expect(result.authenticated).toBe(true);
    expect(result.user.email).toBeDefined();
  });
  
  test('REQ-AUTH-003: Account lockout after failed attempts', async () => {
    // Test account lockout mechanism
    for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
      await attemptLogin('test@example.com', 'wrongpassword');
    }
    const result = await attemptLogin('test@example.com', 'correctpassword');
