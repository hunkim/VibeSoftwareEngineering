    kubectl patch service myapp -p '{"spec":{"selector":{"version":"green"}}}'
    # Cleanup blue environment after successful deployment
    kubectl delete -f k8s/blue/
```

### Pipeline Stages and Gates

#### **Quality Gates**
Quality gates are automated checkpoints that prevent problematic code from advancing through the pipeline:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Quality Gates"
        A["Unit Tests<br/>â‰¥90% Pass Rate"]
        B["Code Coverage<br/>â‰¥80% Coverage"]
        C["Security Scan<br/>No High Severity"]
        D["Performance Tests<br/>â‰¤500ms Response"]
    end
    
    subgraph "Approval Gates"
        E["Manual Review<br/>Required"]
        F["Stakeholder<br/>Approval"]
        G["Compliance<br/>Check"]
    end
    
    H["Code Changes"] --> A
    A -->|Pass| I["Continue Pipeline"]
    A -->|Fail| J["Block Pipeline"]
    
    I --> B
    B -->|Pass| K["Quality Approved"]
    B -->|Fail| J
    
    K --> E
    E -->|Approved| L["Deploy to Production"]
    E -->|Rejected| M["Return to Development"]

    style C fill:#c8e6c9
    style D fill:#c8e6c9
    style J fill:#ffcdd2
    style L fill:#bbdefb
```

```yaml
# Example quality gate configuration
quality_gates:
  unit_tests:
    threshold: 90%
    blocking: true
  code_coverage:
    threshold: 80%
    blocking: true
  security_scan:
    severity: high
    blocking: true
  performance_tests:
    response_time: 500ms
    blocking: false  # Warning only
```

#### **Approval Gates**
For critical deployments, manual approval gates provide human oversight:

```yaml
# Production deployment approval
- name: Request Production Approval
  uses: trstringer/manual-approval@v1
  with:
    secret: ${{ github.TOKEN }}
    approvers: devops-team,tech-leads
    minimum-approvals: 2
    issue-title: "Production Deployment: ${{ github.sha }}"
```

## 10.2 Continuous Integration: Building Quality In

Continuous Integration (CI) is the practice of regularly merging code changes into a shared repository, with each integration verified by automated builds and tests. This approach catches integration issues early and ensures that the main codebase remains in a deployable state.

### Core CI Principles

#### **1. Single Source of Truth**
All code, configuration, and infrastructure definitions should be version-controlled:

```
repository/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/                    # Application source code
â”œâ”€â”€ tests/                  # Test suites
â”œâ”€â”€ infrastructure/         # Infrastructure as Code
â”œâ”€â”€ configs/               # Configuration files
â”œâ”€â”€ scripts/               # Build and deployment scripts
â”œâ”€â”€ docs/                  # Documentation
â””â”€â”€ .github/workflows/     # CI/CD pipeline definitions
```

#### **2. Automated Build Process**
Every code change triggers an automated build:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
name: Continuous Integration

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [16.x, 18.x, 20.x]
    
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    
    - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      with:
        node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
        cache: 'npm'
    
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm ci
    
    - name: Run linting
      run: npm run lint
    
    - name: Run unit tests
      run: npm run test:unit
    
    - name: Run integration tests
      run: npm run test:integration
    
    - name: Build application
      run: npm run build
    
    - name: Run security audit
      run: npm audit --audit-level high
```

#### **3. Fast Feedback Loops**
CI pipelines should provide rapid feedback to developers:

```yaml
# Optimized pipeline with parallel execution
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        test-suite: [unit, integration, e2e]
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Setup
      run: npm ci
    - name: Run ${{ matrix.test-suite }} tests
      run: npm run test:${{ matrix.test-suite }}

  security:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Security scan
      uses: securecodewarrior/github-action-add-sarif@v1

  quality:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Code quality analysis
      uses: sonarcloud-github-action@master
```

### Advanced CI Practices

#### **Branch Protection and Quality Gates**

```yaml
# Branch protection rules
branch_protection:
  main:
    required_status_checks:
      - "test (unit)"
      - "test (integration)"
      - "security"
      - "quality"
    enforce_admins: true
    required_pull_request_reviews:
      required_approving_review_count: 2
      dismiss_stale_reviews: true
```

#### **Artifact Management**
```yaml
- name: Build and publish Docker image
  run: |
    docker build -t ${{ env.REGISTRY }}/${{ env.IMAGE_NAME }}:${{ github.sha }} .
    docker tag ${{ env.REGISTRY }}/${{ env.IMAGE_NAME }}:${{ github.sha }} \
               ${{ env.REGISTRY }}/${{ env.IMAGE_NAME }}:latest
    docker push ${{ env.REGISTRY }}/${{ env.IMAGE_NAME }}:${{ github.sha }}
    docker push ${{ env.REGISTRY }}/${{ env.IMAGE_NAME }}:latest

- name: Upload build artifacts
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
  with:
    name: build-artifacts
    path: |
      dist/
      docker-compose.yml
      k8s/
```

#### **Database Integration Testing**
```yaml
services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres:13
    env:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: testpass
      POSTGRES_DB: testdb
    options: >-
      --health-cmd pg_isready
      --health-interval 10s
      --health-timeout 5s
      --health-retries 5

steps:
- name: Run database migrations
  run: npm run db:migrate
  env:
    DATABASE_URL: postgresql://postgres:testpass@localhost:5432/testdb

- name: Run integration tests
  run: npm run test:integration
  env:
    DATABASE_URL: postgresql://postgres:testpass@localhost:5432/testdb
```

### ðŸ’¡ **Vibe Coding Prompt: Microservices CI Optimization**

## 10.3 Continuous Delivery: Automating the Path to Production

Continuous Delivery (CD) extends CI by automating the deployment process, ensuring that code changes can be reliably and safely released to production at any time. CD encompasses deployment automation, environment management, and release orchestration.

### Deployment Strategies

#### **1. Blue-Green Deployment**
Blue-Green deployment maintains two identical production environments, allowing instant rollback and zero-downtime deployments:

```yaml
# Blue-Green deployment workflow
name: Blue-Green Deployment

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Determine current environment
      id: current
      run: |
        CURRENT=$(kubectl get service myapp -o jsonpath='{.spec.selector.version}')
        if [ "$CURRENT" = "blue" ]; then
          echo "::set-output name=current::blue"
          echo "::set-output name=target::green"
        else
          echo "::set-output name=current::green"
          echo "::set-output name=target::blue"
        fi

    - name: Deploy to target environment
      run: |
        kubectl apply -f k8s/${{ steps.current.outputs.target }}/
        kubectl set image deployment/myapp-${{ steps.current.outputs.target }} \
          myapp=myapp:${{ github.sha }}
        kubectl rollout status deployment/myapp-${{ steps.current.outputs.target }}

    - name: Run health checks
      run: |
        ./scripts/health-check.sh ${{ steps.current.outputs.target }}
        ./scripts/smoke-tests.sh ${{ steps.current.outputs.target }}

    - name: Switch traffic
      run: |
        kubectl patch service myapp \
          -p '{"spec":{"selector":{"version":"${{ steps.current.outputs.target }}"}}}'

    - name: Verify deployment
      run: |
        sleep 30
        ./scripts/post-deployment-tests.sh

    - name: Cleanup old environment
      run: |
        kubectl delete deployment myapp-${{ steps.current.outputs.current }}
```

#### **2. Canary Deployment**
Canary deployments gradually roll out changes to a subset of users:

```yaml
# Canary deployment with traffic splitting
- name: Deploy Canary
  run: |
    # Deploy canary version (10% traffic)
    kubectl apply -f k8s/canary/
    kubectl set image deployment/myapp-canary myapp=myapp:${{ github.sha }}
    
    # Configure traffic split
    kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
    apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
    kind: VirtualService
    metadata:
      name: myapp
    spec:
      http:
      - match:
        - headers:
            canary:
              exact: "true"
        route:
        - destination:
            host: myapp-canary
      - route:
        - destination:
            host: myapp-stable
          weight: 90
        - destination:
            host: myapp-canary
          weight: 10
    EOF

- name: Monitor Canary Metrics
  run: |
    # Monitor error rates and performance
    ./scripts/monitor-canary.sh 300  # Monitor for 5 minutes
    
- name: Promote or Rollback
  run: |
    if ./scripts/canary-success-check.sh; then
      # Promote canary to stable
      kubectl patch deployment myapp-stable --patch \
        '{"spec":{"template":{"spec":{"containers":[{"name":"myapp","image":"myapp:${{ github.sha }}"}]}}}}'
      kubectl delete deployment myapp-canary
    else
      # Rollback canary
      kubectl delete deployment myapp-canary
      exit 1
    fi
```

#### **3. Rolling Deployment**
Rolling deployments gradually replace instances of the old version:

```yaml
# Rolling deployment configuration
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: myapp
spec:
  replicas: 10
  strategy:
    type: RollingUpdate
    rollingUpdate:
      maxUnavailable: 2    # Maximum 2 pods unavailable during update
      maxSurge: 2          # Maximum 2 extra pods during update
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: myapp
        image: myapp:${{ github.sha }}
        readinessProbe:
          httpGet:
            path: /health
            port: 8080
          initialDelaySeconds: 10
          periodSeconds: 5
        livenessProbe:
          httpGet:
            path: /health
            port: 8080
          initialDelaySeconds: 30
          periodSeconds: 10
```

### Environment Management

#### **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**
```yaml
# Terraform deployment pipeline
- name: Terraform Plan
  run: |
    cd infrastructure/
    terraform init
    terraform plan -out=tfplan

- name: Terraform Apply
  if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
  run: |
    cd infrastructure/
    terraform apply tfplan

# Kubernetes manifests
- name: Deploy to Kubernetes
  run: |
    envsubst < k8s/deployment.yaml.template > k8s/deployment.yaml
    kubectl apply -f k8s/
```

#### **Configuration Management**
```yaml
# Environment-specific configuration
environments:
  development:
    database_url: "postgres://dev-db:5432/myapp"
    api_url: "https://api-dev.myapp.com"
    log_level: "debug"
  
  staging:
    database_url: "postgres://staging-db:5432/myapp"
    api_url: "https://api-staging.myapp.com"
    log_level: "info"
  
  production:
    database_url: "${{ secrets.PROD_DATABASE_URL }}"
    api_url: "https://api.myapp.com"
