## 2.1 The SOLID Principles: Building Robust and Maintainable Systems

The SOLID principles represent a set of five fundamental design guidelines that, when applied systematically, lead to software systems that are more robust, maintainable, and extensible. Originally formulated by Robert C. Martin, these principles are widely recognized in object-oriented programming but hold relevance across various paradigms and modern development approaches.

### Why SOLID Matters

Before diving into each principle, it's crucial to understand the problems SOLID principles solve:
- **Rigidity**: Systems that are hard to change because every change affects too many other parts
- **Fragility**: Systems that break in unexpected places when you make changes
- **Immobility**: Systems where you can't easily reuse components in other applications
- **Viscosity**: When it's easier to hack than to preserve design integrity

---

### 2.1.1 Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

> *"A class should have one, and only one, reason to change."* - Robert C. Martin

#### The Principle Explained

The Single Responsibility Principle mandates that every class or module within a software system should be responsible for a single, well-defined piece of functionality. This principle is often misunderstood as "a class should do only one thing," but it's more accurately described as "a class should have only one reason to change."

#### Identifying Responsibilities

To identify whether a class violates SRP, ask these questions:
1. **Who are the stakeholders?** Different stakeholders represent different reasons for change
2. **What would cause this class to change?** Multiple reasons indicate multiple responsibilities
3. **Can you describe the class in a single sentence without using "and" or "or"?**

#### Benefits of SRP

- **Easier Testing**: Smaller, focused classes are simpler to test comprehensively
- **Reduced Coupling**: Classes with single responsibilities have fewer dependencies
- **Improved Maintainability**: Changes affect smaller, more isolated code sections
- **Enhanced Reusability**: Focused classes are more likely to be useful in different contexts

#### Common SRP Violations

| Violation Type | Example | Problem | Solution |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Mixed Concerns** | `UserReportGenerator` handles both data logic and email sending | Two reasons to change: data format changes and email service changes | Split into `ReportGenerator` and `EmailService` |
| **God Classes** | `OrderManager` handles validation, persistence, notifications, and calculations | Multiple stakeholders, multiple reasons to change | Break into focused services following domain boundaries |
| **Utility Classes** | `Utils` class with unrelated helper methods | Grows without bounds, unclear purpose | Create specific utility classes for related functions |

### 💡 **Vive Coding Prompt: SRP Refactoring Challenge**

**Scenario**: You've inherited a legacy `UserReport` class that has grown over time to handle multiple responsibilities.

```python
class UserReport:
    def __init__(self, user_id):
        self.user_id = user_id
        self.db_connection = Database.connect()
    
    def fetch_user_data(self):
        # Database queries
        pass
    
    def generate_pdf(self):
        # PDF generation logic
        pass
    
    def send_email(self):
        # Email sending logic
        pass
    
    def validate_user_permissions(self):
        # Permission checking
        pass
    
    def log_report_generation(self):
        # Logging logic
        pass
```

**Your Task**:
1. **Identify Responsibilities**: List all the different responsibilities this class handles
2. **Identify Stakeholders**: For each responsibility, identify who would request changes
3. **Design New Structure**: Create a class diagram showing how you would split these responsibilities
4. **Implementation Plan**: 
   - Which class would you extract first? Why?
   - How would you handle dependencies between the new classes?
   - What interfaces would you create to maintain flexibility?
5. **Testing Strategy**: How would your new design improve testability?

**Deliverable**: A refactored design with clear separation of responsibilities and a migration plan.

### 2.1.2 Open-Closed Principle (OCP)

> *"Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification."* - Bertrand Meyer

#### The Principle Explained

The Open-Closed Principle states that you should be able to extend a class's behavior without modifying its existing code. This might seem contradictory, but it's achievable through abstraction mechanisms like inheritance, interfaces, and composition.

#### Achieving OCP Through Abstraction

**Strategy 1: Interface-Based Extension**
```python
# Closed for modification, open for extension
class ReportExporter:
    def export(self, data: ReportData) -> str:
        raise NotImplementedError
    
class XMLExporter(ReportExporter):
    def export(self, data: ReportData) -> str:
        # XML-specific implementation
        pass

class JSONExporter(ReportExporter):
    def export(self, data: ReportData) -> str:
        # JSON-specific implementation
        pass
```

**Strategy 2: Configuration-Driven Behavior**
```python
class NotificationService:
    def __init__(self, strategies: List[NotificationStrategy]):
        self.strategies = strategies
    
    def notify(self, message: Message):
        for strategy in self.strategies:
            strategy.send(message)
```

#### Benefits of OCP

- **Reduced Risk**: New features don't require changing tested code
- **Easier Maintenance**: Bug fixes in new features don't affect existing functionality
- **Better Testing**: New behavior can be tested independently
- **Improved Modularity**: Clear extension points make architecture more understandable

### 💡 **Vive Coding Prompt: Payment Processing Extension**

**Scenario**: Your e-commerce system currently supports credit card payments, but you need to add PayPal, Apple Pay, and cryptocurrency options.

**Current Implementation** (violates OCP):
```python
class PaymentProcessor:
    def process_payment(self, amount, payment_type, details):
        if payment_type == "credit_card":
            return self._process_credit_card(amount, details)
        elif payment_type == "paypal":
            return self._process_paypal(amount, details)
        # More if-else statements for each new payment type
```

**Your Task**:
1. **Design Extension-Friendly Architecture**: Create an interface-based design that supports adding new payment methods without modifying existing code
2. **Implement Core Interfaces**: Define the abstractions needed for payment processing
3. **Migration Strategy**: How would you refactor the existing code to use your new design?
4. **Validation Framework**: How would you ensure all payment processors follow the same validation rules?
5. **Configuration Management**: Design a system for dynamically enabling/disabling payment methods

**Bonus Challenge**: Design the system to support:
- Different fee structures per payment method
- Region-specific payment method availability
- A/B testing of payment flows

**Deliverable**: A complete payment processing architecture that demonstrates OCP compliance.

### 2.1.3 Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

> *"Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without breaking the application."* - Barbara Liskov

#### The Principle Explained

LSP is often the most challenging SOLID principle to grasp and apply correctly. It requires that derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes without altering the correctness of the program. This goes beyond simple inheritance—it's about behavioral compatibility.

#### LSP Requirements

For a subclass to properly substitute its parent class, it must maintain:

1. **Preconditions cannot be strengthened**: Subclasses cannot make stricter demands than the parent
2. **Postconditions cannot be weakened**: Subclasses must meet or exceed parent guarantees
3. **Invariants must be preserved**: Class-level constraints must remain valid
4. **History constraint**: Subclasses shouldn't allow state changes that the parent wouldn't allow

#### Common LSP Violations

**The Rectangle-Square Problem**:
```python
class Rectangle:
    def set_width(self, width):
        self._width = width
    
    def set_height(self, height):
        self._height = height
    
    def area(self):
        return self._width * self._height

class Square(Rectangle):  # LSP Violation!
    def set_width(self, width):
        self._width = width
        self._height = width  # Unexpected behavior
    
    def set_height(self, height):
        self._width = height  # Unexpected behavior
        self._height = height
```

**Why This Violates LSP**:
```python
def calculate_area_increase(rectangle: Rectangle):
    original_area = rectangle.area()
    rectangle.set_width(rectangle.width + 1)
    return rectangle.area() - original_area

# This function behaves differently with Square vs Rectangle
```

#### Better Design Approaches

**Option 1: Immutable Design**
```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Shape(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def area(self) -> float:
        pass

class Rectangle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, width: float, height: float):
        self._width = width
        self._height = height
    
    def area(self) -> float:
        return self._width * self._height
    
    def with_width(self, width: float) -> 'Rectangle':
        return Rectangle(width, self._height)

class Square(Shape):
    def __init__(self, side: float):
        self._side = side
    
    def area(self) -> float:
        return self._side ** 2
```

### 💡 **Vive Coding Prompt: Vehicle Hierarchy Design**

**Scenario**: You're designing a vehicle management system for a transportation company that handles cars, trucks, motorcycles, and electric vehicles.

**Current Problematic Design**:
```python
class Vehicle:
    def start_engine(self):
        print("Engine started")
    
    def fuel_up(self, amount):
        self.fuel_level += amount
    
    def shift_gear(self, gear):
        self.current_gear = gear

class ElectricCar(Vehicle):
    def start_engine(self):  # LSP violation - no engine!
        print("Battery system activated")
    
    def fuel_up(self, amount):  # LSP violation - no fuel!
        raise NotSupportedError("Electric cars don't use fuel")

class Motorcycle(Vehicle):
    def shift_gear(self, gear):  # Some motorcycles are automatic
        if self.is_automatic:
            raise NotSupportedError("Automatic transmission")
        super().shift_gear(gear)
```

**Your Task**:
1. **Identify LSP Violations**: List all the ways the current design violates LSP
2. **Redesign the Hierarchy**: Create a proper inheritance structure that respects LSP
3. **Define Contracts**: Specify preconditions, postconditions, and invariants for each abstraction
4. **Composition vs Inheritance**: Decide which behaviors should be inherited vs composed
5. **Validation**: Write test cases that verify LSP compliance

**Design Constraints**:
- Support both fuel-based and electric vehicles
- Handle both manual and automatic transmissions
- Account for different starting mechanisms (key, button, app)
- Support vehicles with different numbers of wheels

**Deliverable**: A vehicle hierarchy that passes the LSP substitution test with comprehensive documentation of contracts.

### 2.1.4 Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

> *"Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces they do not use."* - Robert C. Martin

#### The Principle Explained

ISP advocates for creating focused, client-specific interfaces rather than large, monolithic ones. When interfaces are too broad, clients become coupled to methods they don't need, leading to unnecessary dependencies and more fragile code.

#### Benefits of ISP

- **Reduced Coupling**: Clients depend only on the methods they actually use
- **Better Testability**: Smaller interfaces are easier to mock and test
- **Improved Maintainability**: Changes to unused methods don't affect clients
- **Enhanced Flexibility**: Different clients can evolve independently

#### ISP in Practice

**Before ISP (Fat Interface)**:
```python
class WorkerInterface:
    def work(self): pass
    def eat(self): pass
    def sleep(self): pass
    def supervise(self): pass
    def program(self): pass
```

**After ISP (Segregated Interfaces)**:
```python
class Workable:
    def work(self): pass

class Eatable:
    def eat(self): pass

class Sleepable:
    def sleep(self): pass

class Supervisable:
    def supervise(self): pass

class Programmable:
    def program(self): pass

# Clients implement only what they need
class Human(Workable, Eatable, Sleepable):
    pass

class Robot(Workable, Programmable):
    pass

class Manager(Supervisable, Eatable, Sleepable):
    pass
```

### 💡 **Vive Coding Prompt: API Gateway Interface Design**

**Scenario**: You're designing interfaces for an API Gateway that serves different types of clients: mobile apps, web applications, third-party integrations, and internal services.

**Current Monolithic Interface**:
```python
class APIGatewayInterface:
    # Authentication
    def authenticate_user(self, credentials): pass
    def authenticate_service(self, api_key): pass
    def validate_jwt_token(self, token): pass
    
    # Rate Limiting
    def check_rate_limit(self, client_id): pass
    def update_rate_limit(self, client_id): pass
    
    # Caching
    def get_cached_response(self, key): pass
    def set_cached_response(self, key, value): pass
    def invalidate_cache(self, pattern): pass
    
    # Analytics
    def log_request(self, request_data): pass
    def get_analytics_data(self, filters): pass
    def generate_reports(self, parameters): pass
    
    # Admin Functions
    def manage_clients(self, action, client_data): pass
    def configure_routing(self, rules): pass
    def update_security_policies(self, policies): pass
```

**Your Task**:
1. **Client Analysis**: Identify what each client type actually needs
   - Mobile apps: Authentication, basic rate limiting
   - Web apps: Authentication, caching, basic analytics
   - Third-party: Service authentication, strict rate limiting
   - Internal services: No rate limiting, full caching, admin functions

2. **Interface Segregation**: Design focused interfaces for each client type
3. **Implementation Strategy**: Show how a single gateway class can implement multiple interfaces
4. **Dependency Management**: Design how clients will receive only their required interfaces
5. **Evolution Plan**: How would you add new client types without affecting existing ones?

**Advanced Challenges**:
- Design interfaces that support both sync and async operations
- Handle partial implementations (some clients need read-only access)
- Support interface versioning for backward compatibility

**Deliverable**: A set of segregated interfaces with clear client-to-interface mapping and implementation examples.

### 2.1.5 Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

> *"High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions."* - Robert C. Martin

#### The Principle Explained

DIP is fundamental to achieving flexible, testable architecture. It has two key parts:
1. High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
2. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.

#### Traditional Dependency Flow (Problem)
```
High-Level Module → Low-Level Module
    (Business Logic) → (Database/Framework)
```

#### Inverted Dependency Flow (Solution)
```
High-Level Module → Abstraction ← Low-Level Module
    (Business Logic) → (Interface) ← (Database/Framework)
```

#### DIP Implementation Patterns

**Pattern 1: Interface Injection**
```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class PaymentRepository(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def save_payment(self, payment: Payment) -> bool:
        pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    def find_payment(self, payment_id: str) -> Payment:
        pass

class PaymentService:  # High-level module
    def __init__(self, repository: PaymentRepository):
        self._repository = repository  # Depends on abstraction
    
    def process_payment(self, payment_data: dict) -> PaymentResult:
        # Business logic doesn't depend on specific database
        payment = Payment(payment_data)
        success = self._repository.save_payment(payment)
        return PaymentResult(success, payment.id)

class SQLPaymentRepository(PaymentRepository):  # Low-level module
    def save_payment(self, payment: Payment) -> bool:
        # SQL-specific implementation
        pass
```

**Pattern 2: Factory Pattern**
```python
class DatabaseFactory:
    @staticmethod
    def create_repository(db_type: str) -> PaymentRepository:
        if db_type == "sql":
            return SQLPaymentRepository()
        elif db_type == "nosql":
            return NoSQLPaymentRepository()
        else:
            raise ValueError(f"Unknown database type: {db_type}")
```

#### Benefits of DIP

- **Testability**: High-level modules can be tested with mock implementations
- **Flexibility**: Easy to swap implementations without changing business logic
- **Reduced Coupling**: Business logic is independent of technical details
- **Better Architecture**: Clear separation between policy and implementation

### 💡 **Vive Coding Prompt: E-commerce Order Processing System**

**Scenario**: You're building an order processing system that needs to handle payments, inventory management, shipping, and notifications. Currently, everything is tightly coupled to specific implementations.

**Current Problematic Code**:
```python
class OrderProcessor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.payment_gateway = StripePaymentGateway()  # Tight coupling
        self.inventory_system = MySQLInventoryDB()     # Tight coupling
        self.shipping_service = FedExShippingAPI()     # Tight coupling
        self.notification_service = SMTPEmailService() # Tight coupling
    
    def process_order(self, order_data):
        # Business logic mixed with implementation details
        if self.inventory_system.check_stock(order_data['items']):
            payment_result = self.payment_gateway.charge_card(
                order_data['payment_info']
            )
            if payment_result.success:
                self.inventory_system.reserve_items(order_data['items'])
                shipping_label = self.shipping_service.create_label(
                    order_data['shipping']
                )
                self.notification_service.send_confirmation_email(
                    order_data['customer_email']
                )
```

**Your Task**:
1. **Identify Dependencies**: List all the low-level dependencies in the current code
2. **Design Abstractions**: Create interfaces that capture the essential operations without implementation details
3. **Refactor Business Logic**: Rewrite the OrderProcessor to depend only on abstractions
4. **Dependency Injection**: Design a system for injecting dependencies (constructor, setter, or framework-based)
5. **Configuration Management**: How will you manage different implementations for different environments (dev, staging, prod)?

**Advanced Requirements**:
- Support multiple payment processors with fallback logic
- Handle partial order fulfillment (some items out of stock)
- Support different shipping options with different carriers
- Implement retry logic for failed external service calls
- Add comprehensive logging and monitoring

**Testing Requirements**:
- Write unit tests that don't require external services
- Create integration tests that verify the wiring works correctly
- Design contract tests to ensure implementations satisfy interfaces

**Deliverable**: A completely refactored order processing system that demonstrates proper dependency inversion with comprehensive test coverage.

### SOLID Principles Summary

| Principle | Key Question | Main Benefit | Common Violation |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|------------------|
| **SRP** | "What would cause this class to change?" | Focused, testable classes | God classes with multiple responsibilities |
| **OCP** | "Can I add new behavior without changing existing code?" | Risk-free extension | Long if-else chains for new features |
| **LSP** | "Can I substitute any subclass for its parent?" | Reliable polymorphism | Subclasses that change expected behavior |
| **ISP** | "Do all clients need all these methods?" | Minimal coupling | Fat interfaces with unused methods |
| **DIP** | "Does my business logic depend on implementation details?" | Testable, flexible architecture | Direct dependencies on frameworks/databases |

---

## 2.2 DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself): Eliminating Redundancy

### The Principle Defined

The "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) principle, formulated by Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas in "The Pragmatic Programmer," states: *"Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system."*

### Understanding "Knowledge" in DRY

DRY isn't just about avoiding duplicate code—it's about avoiding duplicate *knowledge*. This includes:
- **Business Rules**: Validation logic, calculation formulas, workflow rules
- **Configuration**: Database connections, API endpoints, feature flags
- **Data Structures**: Schema definitions, message formats, API contracts
- **Algorithms**: Sorting logic, encryption methods, parsing rules

### DRY vs. WET vs. AHA

| Approach | Philosophy | When to Use |
|----------|------------|-------------|
| **DRY** | Eliminate all duplication | When patterns are truly identical and will evolve together |
| **WET** (Write Everything Twice) | Allow some duplication | When unsure if similarities are coincidental |
| **AHA** (Avoid Hasty Abstractions) | Abstract after patterns emerge | When you see the same thing three times |

### 💡 **Vive Coding Prompt: User Validation Refactoring**

**Scenario**: Your application has user validation logic scattered across multiple components.

**Current Duplication**:
```python
# In UserRegistrationController
def register_user(self, user_data):
    if not user_data.get('email') or '@' not in user_data['email']:
        raise ValidationError("Invalid email")
    if not user_data.get('password') or len(user_data['password']) < 8:
        raise ValidationError("Password too short")
    # ... rest of registration logic

# In UserUpdateController  
def update_user(self, user_id, user_data):
    if user_data.get('email') and '@' not in user_data['email']:
        raise ValidationError("Invalid email")
    if user_data.get('password') and len(user_data['password']) < 8:
        raise ValidationError("Password too short")
    # ... rest of update logic

# In UserImportService
def import_users(self, user_list):
    for user_data in user_list:
        if not user_data.get('email') or '@' not in user_data['email']:
            continue  # Skip invalid users
        if not user_data.get('password') or len(user_data['password']) < 8:
            continue  # Skip invalid users
        # ... rest of import logic
```

**Your Task**:
1. **Identify Knowledge Duplication**: What specific knowledge is duplicated?
2. **Design Abstraction**: Create a reusable validation system
3. **Handle Variations**: Different contexts have slightly different validation needs
4. **Maintain Flexibility**: Support adding new validation rules easily
5. **Error Handling**: Provide consistent error messages across all usages

**Deliverable**: A DRY validation system with examples of how each original component would use it.

---

## 2.3 KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid): Embracing Simplicity

### The Philosophy of Simplicity

The KISS principle, originating from the U.S. Navy, emphasizes that systems work best when they are kept simple rather than made complex. In software development, this translates to choosing the simplest solution that effectively solves the problem.

### Simplicity Guidelines

1. **Favor Composition Over Inheritance**: Complex inheritance hierarchies are hard to understand
2. **Use Standard Library Solutions**: Don't reinvent common functionality
3. **Minimize Dependencies**: Each dependency adds complexity
4. **Clear Over Clever**: Code should be obvious, not impressive
5. **Delete Dead Code**: Remove unused functionality

### Complexity Indicators

**Warning Signs Your Code Might Be Too Complex**:
- New team members need more than a day to understand a component
- You need extensive documentation to explain basic operations
- Changes in one area unexpectedly break other areas
- Unit tests are difficult to write or understand

### 💡 **Vive Coding Prompt: Algorithm Simplification**

**Scenario**: A team member has implemented a custom sorting algorithm for user rankings, but it's causing confusion and bugs.

**Current Complex Implementation**:
```python
class UserRankingSorter:
    def __init__(self):
        self.comparison_strategies = {
            'score': ScoreComparisonStrategy(),
            'time': TimeComparisonStrategy(),
            'hybrid': HybridComparisonStrategy()
        }
        self.sort_algorithms = {
            'quick': QuickSortAlgorithm(),
            'merge': MergeSortAlgorithm(),
            'heap': HeapSortAlgorithm()
        }
    
    def sort_users(self, users, strategy='hybrid', algorithm='quick'):
        comparator = self.comparison_strategies[strategy]
        sorter = self.sort_algorithms[algorithm]
        return sorter.sort(users, comparator.compare)
```

**Your Task**:
1. **Complexity Analysis**: Identify what makes this code complex
2. **Requirements Gathering**: What does the system actually need to do?
3. **Simple Solution**: Propose a KISS-compliant alternative
4. **Trade-off Analysis**: What do you gain/lose with the simpler approach?
5. **Migration Strategy**: How would you transition from complex to simple?

**Constraints**:
- Must handle 3 different ranking criteria
- Performance is important (1000+ users)
- New ranking criteria might be added in the future

**Deliverable**: A simplified ranking system with justification for design choices.

## 2.4 YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It): Avoiding Premature Optimization

### The Principle Explained

YAGNI, from Extreme Programming (XP), states that developers should not add functionality until it is demonstrably necessary. The principle combats the tendency to build features based on speculation rather than actual requirements.

### YAGNI Implementation Strategies

1. **Build the Minimum Viable Feature**: Implement only what's needed now
2. **Refactor When Needed**: Add complexity only when requirements demand it
3. **Test-Driven Development**: Let tests drive what functionality is actually needed
4. **Continuous Integration**: Small, frequent changes make it easier to add features later

### YAGNI vs. Good Design

YAGNI doesn't mean ignoring good design principles:
- **Do**: Follow SOLID principles, write clean code, create good abstractions
- **Don't**: Build features you think you'll need someday
- **Do**: Design for change and extension
- **Don't**: Over-engineer for hypothetical requirements

### 💡 **Vive Coding Prompt: Feature Scope Management**

**Scenario**: Your team is building a user notification system. The product manager has outlined current needs, but developers are suggesting additional "future-proofing" features.

**Current Requirements**:
- Send email notifications for password resets
- Send email notifications for account verification
- Basic logging of sent notifications

**Proposed "Future-Proofing" Features**:
- Support for SMS notifications (no current requirement)
- Multi-language template system (only English needed now)
- Advanced analytics dashboard (just basic logging requested)
- Plugin architecture for custom notification types
- Rate limiting and batching system
- A/B testing framework for notifications

**Your Task**:
1. **YAGNI Analysis**: Categorize each proposed feature as "build now," "build later," or "don't build"
2. **Cost-Benefit Assessment**: Estimate the cost of building vs. cost of adding later
3. **Design Foundation**: What minimal foundation would make future additions easier?
4. **Implementation Plan**: Create a phased implementation approach
5. **Decision Framework**: Develop criteria for when to add complexity

**Deliverable**: A notification system design that satisfies current needs while remaining extensible.

---

## 2.5 Separation of Concerns (SoC): Dividing Responsibilities

### The Principle Defined

Separation of Concerns involves dividing a computer program into distinct sections, each addressing a separate "concern" or responsibility. This creates systems where every part fulfills a meaningful and intuitive role while maximizing adaptability to change.

### Types of Separation

1. **Horizontal Separation**: Dividing by architectural layers (UI, Business Logic, Data)
2. **Vertical Separation**: Dividing by business functionality (User Management, Payment Processing)
3. **Aspect Separation**: Dividing cross-cutting concerns (logging, security, caching)

### Implementation Approaches

**Layered Architecture**:
```
Presentation Layer    → User Interface, Controllers
Business Logic Layer  → Services, Domain Models
Data Access Layer     → Repositories, Database
```

**Domain-Driven Design**:
```
User Context     → User registration, authentication
Payment Context  → Payment processing, billing
Order Context    → Order management, fulfillment
```

### 💡 **Vive Coding Prompt: Web Controller Refactoring**

**Scenario**: Your web application has controllers that handle too many responsibilities.

**Current Problematic Controller**:
```python
class UserController:
    def create_user(self, request):
        # Parse and validate request data
        user_data = request.json
        if not user_data.get('email'):
            return {'error': 'Email required'}, 400
        
        # Check business rules
        if User.count_by_email(user_data['email']) > 0:
            return {'error': 'Email already exists'}, 409
        
        # Hash password
        hashed_password = bcrypt.hashpw(
            user_data['password'].encode('utf-8'), 
            bcrypt.gensalt()
        )
        
        # Save to database
        connection = sqlite3.connect('users.db')
        cursor = connection.cursor()
        cursor.execute(
            "INSERT INTO users (email, password) VALUES (?, ?)",
            (user_data['email'], hashed_password)
        )
        connection.commit()
        connection.close()
        
        # Send welcome email
        smtp_server = smtplib.SMTP('smtp.gmail.com', 587)
        smtp_server.starttls()
        smtp_server.login('app@company.com', 'password')
        smtp_server.send_message(
            create_welcome_email(user_data['email'])
        )
        smtp_server.quit()
        
        # Log the action
        with open('user_actions.log', 'a') as log_file:
            log_file.write(f"User created: {user_data['email']}\n")
        
        return {'message': 'User created successfully'}, 201
```

**Your Task**:
1. **Identify Concerns**: List all the different concerns this controller handles
2. **Design Separation**: Create a layered architecture that properly separates concerns
3. **Define Interfaces**: Specify the contracts between layers
4. **Refactor Implementation**: Show how the controller would look after separation
5. **Testing Strategy**: Explain how separation improves testability

**Architectural Constraints**:
- HTTP handling should remain in the controller
- Business logic should be framework-independent
- Data access should be abstracted
- External services should be mockable for testing

**Deliverable**: A refactored architecture with clear separation of concerns and improved testability.

## 2.6 Coupling and Cohesion: Achieving Modular Design

### Understanding the Relationship

Coupling and cohesion are inversely related quality metrics that together determine the maintainability and reliability of software systems:
- **Low Coupling + High Cohesion = Good Design**
- **High Coupling + Low Cohesion = Poor Design**

### Types of Coupling (Worst to Best)

| Coupling Type | Description | Example | Coupling Level |
|---------------|-------------|---------|----------------|
| **Content Coupling** | One module modifies another's internal data | Direct access to private variables | Highest (Worst) |
| **Common Coupling** | Modules share global data | Global variables | Very High |
| **External Coupling** | Modules depend on external formats | File format dependencies | High |
| **Control Coupling** | One module controls another's flow | Passing control flags | Medium-High |
| **Data Coupling** | Modules share data through parameters | Method parameters only | Low (Best) |

### Types of Cohesion (Worst to Best)

| Cohesion Type | Description | Example | Cohesion Level |
|---------------|-------------|---------|----------------|
| **Coincidental** | Elements grouped arbitrarily | Utility class with unrelated methods | Lowest (Worst) |
| **Logical** | Elements perform similar operations | All I/O operations in one class | Low |
| **Temporal** | Elements executed at same time | Initialization routines | Medium-Low |
| **Procedural** | Elements follow execution sequence | Sequential processing steps | Medium |
| **Communicational** | Elements operate on same data | CRUD operations for same entity | Medium-High |
| **Sequential** | Output of one is input to next | Data processing pipeline | High |
| **Functional** | Elements contribute to single task | Calculate tax for order | Highest (Best) |

### 💡 **Vive Coding Prompt: Module Restructuring**

**Scenario**: Your inventory management system has grown organically, resulting in poor coupling and cohesion.

**Current Problematic Design**:
```python
class InventoryManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.products = ProductDatabase()
        self.suppliers = SupplierDatabase()
        self.email_service = EmailService()
        self.logger = Logger()
    
    def update_stock(self, product_id, quantity):
        # Directly manipulates product database
        product = self.products.get(product_id)
        product.stock += quantity
        self.products.save(product)
        
        # Tightly coupled to supplier logic
        if product.stock < product.minimum_stock:
            supplier = self.suppliers.get(product.supplier_id)
            order_quantity = supplier.calculate_reorder_quantity(product)
            self.place_supplier_order(supplier, product, order_quantity)
        
        # Mixed responsibilities
        self.email_service.send_stock_update_notification(product)
        self.logger.log(f"Stock updated for {product.name}")
    
    def place_supplier_order(self, supplier, product, quantity):
        # More mixed responsibilities
        pass
```

**Problems Identified**:
- High coupling: Direct database access, mixed concerns
- Low cohesion: Stock management, supplier orders, notifications in one class
- Hard to test: Cannot test stock updates without database and email service

**Your Task**:
1. **Coupling Analysis**: Identify all coupling issues and their types
2. **Cohesion Analysis**: Identify cohesion problems and classify them
3. **Redesign Architecture**: Create a better structure with:
   - High cohesion within modules
   - Low coupling between modules
   - Clear interfaces and dependencies
4. **Dependency Management**: Show how modules will interact
5. **Testing Strategy**: Demonstrate improved testability

**Design Constraints**:
- Must support multiple product types
- Must integrate with multiple suppliers
- Must handle concurrent stock updates
- Must maintain audit trail

**Deliverable**: A restructured inventory system with clear module boundaries and dependency relationships.

## Chapter Summary

Design principles provide the foundation for creating maintainable, extensible software systems. The principles covered in this chapter work together synergistically:

- **SOLID principles** provide object-oriented design guidelines that promote modularity and flexibility
- **DRY** eliminates knowledge duplication to reduce maintenance burden
- **KISS** keeps solutions simple and understandable
- **YAGNI** prevents over-engineering and premature optimization
- **Separation of Concerns** creates clear boundaries between different aspects of the system
- **Coupling and Cohesion** metrics help evaluate and improve modular design

### Key Principles Integration

| Scenario | Primary Principles | Secondary Principles |
|----------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Adding new features** | OCP, YAGNI | SRP, DIP |
| **Refactoring legacy code** | SRP, DRY | SoC, Coupling/Cohesion |
| **Designing new components** | SRP, ISP, DIP | KISS, SoC |
| **Code review** | All principles | Focus on violations |

### Practical Application Guidelines

1. **Start with SRP**: Ensure each class has a single, clear responsibility
2. **Apply DRY judiciously**: Eliminate knowledge duplication, not code duplication
3. **Design for extension**: Use OCP and DIP to create flexible architectures
4. **Keep it simple**: Apply KISS and YAGNI to avoid unnecessary complexity
5. **Measure and improve**: Use coupling and cohesion metrics to guide refactoring
